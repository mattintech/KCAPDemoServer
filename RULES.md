# AI Agent Coding Rules

## 1. Code Length Limits
- **Python files (`.py`)**: Maximum 600 lines per file.
- **JavaScript/HTML files (`.js`, `.html`)**: Maximum 500 lines per file.

## 2. Architecture
- Follow the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern for all new features and refactoring. 
  - **Models**: Handle data and business logic.
  - **Views**: Manage presentation and user interface.
  - **Controllers**: Process input, interact with models, and render views.

## 3. Coding Practices
- No guessing: All code must be based on clear requirements or existing patterns in the codebase.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity and keep code readable.
- Document any non-obvious logic with concise comments.

## 4. General
- Ensure all code changes comply with these rules before merging or deploying.
- If a rule cannot be followed, document the reason clearly in the code and notify the team.
